## Introduction
Powered by the Helium Blockchain, The People’s Network is a global, peer-to-peer wireless network that provides a secure and cost-effective way for devices to interact with the internet. To date, the network provides long-range wireless coverage for LoRaWAN-enabled low-power IoT devices. In the future, the Helium Blockchain and The People’s Network could similarly run on other wireless networks.

The network is made up of Miners around the world who operate hotspots that produce and are compensated in $HNT, the native cryptocurrency of the Helium blockchain. This open source and public blockchain incentivizes the creation and maintenance of physical, decentralized wireless networks. Anyone with access to an ISP connection can purchase a community approved hotspot to become a miner. [Read more about Helium hotspots and mining.](https://www.helium.com/mine)

The Helium Ecosystem has already seen its fair share of use cases as hundreds of companies and thousands of developers are already building on The People’s Network. The scalability and affordability, plus compatibility with thousands of existing devices, have made it a very attractive option for wireless connectivity for air sensors, water tracking, and other asset tracking.

## Grant Program
The Decentralized Wireless Alliance (DeWi) oversees the grant program, which exists to encourage development of infrastructure, tools, applications, and education to benefit the Helium ecosystem and The People's Network. We provide individuals and project teams with access to funding, technical support, and community resources.

DeWi invites active contributors of the Helium community along with IoT, crypto, and wireless enthusiasts to reach out. Grant proposals are reviewed and approved by the DeWi team with input from other leaders and stewards of the Helium ecosystem. 

Teams and individuals are evaluated on the following criteria:

1. Impact
2. Urgency
3. Novelty
4. Design

**Inspiration**
DeWi will prioritize any proposal that has clear potential for near-term positive impact on the Helium ecosystem. 
We strongly encourage new ideas and perspectives that provide evidence or affirmation of demand for the product or service in question.

Absent your own project concept, here are some community sourced projects that don't yet have an owner.
