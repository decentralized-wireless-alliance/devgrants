## Introduction
Powered by the Helium Blockchain, The People’s Network is a global, peer-to-peer wireless network that provides a secure and cost-effective way for devices to interact with the internet. To date, the network provides long-range wireless coverage for LoRaWAN-enabled low-power IoT devices. In the future, the Helium Blockchain and The People’s Network could similarly run on other wireless networks.

The network is made up of Miners around the world who operate hotspots that produce and are compensated in $HNT, the native cryptocurrency of the Helium blockchain. This open source and public blockchain incentivizes the creation and maintenance of physical, decentralized wireless networks. Anyone with access to an ISP connection can purchase a community approved hotspot to become a miner. [Find out more](https://www.helium.com/mine)

The Helium Ecosystem has already seen its fair share of use cases as hundreds of companies and thousands of developers are already building on The People’s Network. The scalability and affordability, plus compatibility with thousands of existing devices, have made it a very attractive option for wireless connectivity for air sensors, water tracking, and other asset tracking.
